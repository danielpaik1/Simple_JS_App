DOCUMENTATION!
In the developer world, very little work is done totally solo. Participating in the developer community, and collaborating effectively in your teams, means building things that other people can easily understand and adapt.

In the last Exercise, you covered the importance of using comments in your code to help any other developers who need to work with it. Another big part of documentation is providing project setup documentation, usually delivered in the form of a README.md file in the GitHub repository. This doc lays out the basics of how someone can engage with the project: what it is, how to set it up, which development environment to use, what dependencies to watch out for, etc.

The “.md” file extension refers to markdown, which is a way of styling text using very basic syntax: e.g., asterisks for bold text. Markdown is super simple: check out GitHub’s Mastering Markdown tutorial.

Topics covered in a project setup doc can range from technical requirements to the libraries used, necessary tools, and connected database. You don’t have to describe every step in detail: just include the tools, and link out to a tutorial for it if needed. If you were to create this type of documentation for your Pokédex application, for instance, you could prepare the following information:

Project description
How to get the project running
Project dependencies (e.g., JavaScript version, ESLint rules)
Which API the project uses
To get into the right habit, you’ll add the README file to your repo at the start of your projects and update it as needed throughout the Achievement, then submit at the end for your mentor to review. For this project’s repo, you can use the project brief to help get started.
